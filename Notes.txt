Should i save the authentication in session or ask the user each refresh?
Does the emails contain multiple links?
Can a user click multiple links? The XML file tracks only one <url>.
Should i count multiple clicks from a user (for a same link)?


I will assume that each campaign email can have multiple links, each link can be clicked by the user 
and they are all tracked.

The architecture im using here, can be used with WebForms, MVC, WebAPI. I scafolded a simple MVC application.
All logic and even the models are separated.
Given more time and information i believe the abstraction can be increased.

For the parsing the XML i can use Serialize/Deserialize library to map the xml to my models. 
I have to research this tho.
